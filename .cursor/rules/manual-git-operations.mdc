# Manual Git Operations Rule

## Core Principle
**NEVER** execute Git commands automatically. All Git operations must be performed manually by the user.

## Prohibited Git Commands
- `git add`
- `git commit`
- `git push`
- `git pull`
- `git merge`
- `git rebase`
- `git checkout`
- `git branch`
- `git tag`
- `git reset`
- `git stash`
- Any other Git operations

## Allowed Operations
- File creation and editing
- Code refactoring
- Component development
- TypeScript type definitions
- Documentation updates
- Cursor rules creation
- Configuration changes
- Package installation (`npm install`)

## When User Requests Git Operations
- Provide detailed commit messages
- Suggest appropriate Git commands
- Explain what changes should be committed
- Provide step-by-step instructions
- Never execute the commands automatically

## Example Response
"I don't execute Git commands automatically. Here are the commands you should run manually:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m 'feat: your commit message'
git push origin main
```

I can help you with code changes, but you'll need to run the Git commands yourself."

## Development Focus
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Follow established patterns and conventions
- Create reusable components
- Implement proper TypeScript types
- Maintain project structure
- Update documentation

## Git Command Suggestions
When providing Git command suggestions:
1. Use conventional commit format
2. Provide detailed commit messages
3. Include file lists when relevant
4. Suggest appropriate branch names
5. Include push/pull instructions when needed
