# No Build or Run Operations Rule

## Core Principle
**NEVER** execute build, run, or deployment commands. Focus only on code development, file creation, and configuration.

## Prohibited Commands
- `npm run build`
- `npm run dev`
- `npm start`
- `yarn build`
- `yarn dev`
- `yarn start`
- `pnpm build`
- `pnpm dev`
- `pnpm start`
- `next build`
- `next dev`
- `next start`
- Any deployment commands (vercel, netlify, etc.)

## Allowed Operations
- File creation and editing
- Code refactoring
- Configuration changes
- Package installation (`npm install`)
- Component development
- TypeScript type definitions
- Documentation updates
- Cursor rules creation

## Development Focus
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Follow established patterns and conventions
- Create reusable components
- Implement proper TypeScript types
- Maintain project structure
- Update documentation

## When User Requests Build/Run
- Inform user that build/run operations are not performed
- Suggest manual execution of commands
- Focus on code quality and structure instead
- Provide guidance on what to check after manual build/run

## Example Response
"I don't execute build or run commands. You can run `npm run dev` manually to test the application. I focus on code development and can help you with any code issues or improvements you encounter."
